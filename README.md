## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

### About Me  

My name is Alexandra Traina, and I am a passionate and driven individual currently exploring the fascinating world of computer science. Over the years, my computer experience has steadily grown through courses, projects, and hands-on practice. I have worked on interesting projects such as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system and have taken courses focusing on algorithms, software development, and computational theory. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills but also helped me appreciate the collaborative and creative aspects of the field.  

One of my favorite courses so far has been Media Aesthetics and Criticism, where I analyzed digital media using programming tools. It gave me a new perspective on combining technology with critical thinking. As for this course, I see myself applying the skills I learn to further my career in artificial intelligence, web development, or data analysis. I hope to leverage this knowledge to contribute meaningfully to projects that have real-world impact.
